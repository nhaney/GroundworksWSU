Source python may be found in LambdaFunctions folder as well as the OperatorWebApp folder. The code in these folders is exactly what I used for the app I had in the demo.

I had a lot of trouble loading a local instance of the AWS database I used so I made some sample json files to test the operator view on. Unfortunately the code I wrote for the backend was unable to be included in a distributable because of the lack of a DB, but I hope that my demo was sufficient in that regard.

The GroundWorksOperatorExample-1.0 is the result of running setuptools on the offline operator view, found in ExamplePackage/OperatorWebApp.

Inside the distributable folder you will first need to run the server in a virtual environment using:
$ . venv/bin/activate
and then to run the web app you may just use
$ python main.py

The web app will then be up and running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

There is some reduced functionality because of the inability to connect to a local AWS instance, but somethings are kept intact like viewing photos from my S3 bucket. 

All of the reports inside the test operator view were taken out of my live database on AWS, so it should give a good idea of how the real version works.

Documentation generated by pydoc may be found in the 'docs' folder in any directory.
